# Stat-Roller
This is a Ruby App that generates 6 sets of totals for the 6 Dungeons and Dragons Character Stats.

It follows the 4-d6 format (rolling a 6-sided dice 4 times), dropping the lowest roll from the stat total, and adding the remaining 3 to the total.

From there, the player can decide which stats they want to put the 6 totals into.

Simply clone down the repo, run the Ruby file with "ruby rolls.rb", and enter "y" for Yes, or "n" for No when prompted. "y" will initiate the rolling process. "n" will close out the app.
